Project 4 - K-Server Problem

Given multiple servers and clients, the goal of the algorithm is to minimize the total distance of all servers, relative to the total optimal distance if entire sequence of requests was known in advance.


Program:
On successful compile and run the program loads a window size (800 X 600)
with 3 servers, yellow (top-left), red (top-right), blue (bottom-middle)


Program cycle:
one every left mouse click program accept a client(point) input.
the point is get served by nearby server. 
the service line is thin-solid line and colored by the server it was serve.


on the right mouse click
it compute the optimal path.
optimal path is a thick-dashed line.

it print out the total service cost at serve-nearby strategy and the optimal cost as well as the ratio

Press 'Esc' or 'Q' to terminate the program.
